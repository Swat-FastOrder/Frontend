# Fast-Order Frontend

## Description of the project :octocat:

Fast Order is an app oriented to be used in restaurants so the communication between the waiters and the kitchen can be on point.

This is an app designed for mobile devices so the waiters can save o modify the client's orders. Also, we have a web page that will be used for whoever works in the kitchen and get the ability to manage the status of the orders and receive real-time updates of them.

By the end of any order, when clients need to pay, they will be able to divide the total between N quantity of people and by doing so, generating separated bills.
